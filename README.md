With this client, you can upload regular raw `Data` or file-paths. 

## Usage

You can refer to the example project to see how TUSKit is implemented. 

As a starting point, please refer to the [SceneDelegate](TUSKitExample/TUSKitExample/SceneDelegate.swift).

Here is how you can instantiate a `TUSClient` instance.

Be sure to store a reference to the client somewhere. Then initialize as you normally would.
``` swift
final class MyClass {
  let tusClient: TUSClient
  
  init() {
      tusClient = TUSClient(config: TUSConfig(server: URL(string: "https://tusd.tusdemo.net/files")!), sessionIdentifier: "TUS DEMO", storageDirectory: URL(string: "TUS")!)
      tusClient.delegate = self
  }
}
```

Note that you can register as a delegate to retrieve the URL's of the uploads, and also any errors that may arise.

Note that you *can* pass your own `URLSession` instance to the initializer.

You can conform to the `TUSClientDelegate` to receive updates from the `TUSClient`.

```swift
extension MyClass: TUSClientDelegate {
    func didStartUpload(id: UUID, client: TUSClient) {
        print("TUSClient started upload, id is \(id)")
        print("TUSClient remaining is \(client.remainingUploads)")
    }
    
    func didFinishUpload(id: UUID, url: URL, client: TUSClient) {
        print("TUSClient finished upload, id is \(id) url is \(url)")
        print("TUSClient remaining is \(client.remainingUploads)")
        if client.remainingUploads == 0 {
            print("Finished uploading")
        }
    }
    
    func uploadFailed(id: UUID, error: Error, client: TUSClient) {
        print("TUSClient upload failed for \(id) error \(error)")
    }
    
    func fileError(error: TUSClientError, client: TUSClient) {
        print("TUSClient File error \(error)")
    }
    
    
    func totalProgress(bytesUploaded: Int, totalBytes: Int, client: TUSClient) {
    }
    
    
    func progressFor(id: UUID, bytesUploaded: Int, totalBytes: Int, client: TUSClient) {

    }
    
}
```

### Starting an upload

A `TUSClient` can upload `Data` or paths to a file in the form of a `URL`.

To upload data, use the `upload(data:)` method`

```swift
let data = Data("I am some data".utf8)
let uploadId = try tusClient.upload(data: data)
```

To upload multiple data files at once, use the `uploadMultiple(dataFiles:)` method.

To upload a single stored file, retrieve a file path and pass it to the client.

```swift
let pathToFile:URL = ...
let uploadId = try tusClient.uploadFileAt(filePath: pathToFile)
```

To upload multiple files at once, you can use the `uploadFiles(filePaths:)` method.

## Custom upload URL and custom headers

To specify a custom upload URL (e.g. for TransloadIt) or custom headers to be added to a file upload, please refer to the `uploadURL` and `customHeaders` properties in the methods related to uploading. Such as: `upload`, `uploadFileAt`, `uploadFiles` or `uploadMultiple(dataFiles:)`.

## Measuring upload progress

To know how many files have yet to be uploaded, please refer to the `remainingUploads` property.

Please note that there isn't a percentage supplied, since it's up to you to define what the starting point is of an upload.
For example. If you upload 10 files, and 3 are finished, then you are at 3/10. However, if during this upload you add 2 more, should that count as 3/12 or do you consider it a a fresh upload? So 0/9. It's up to you to define how finished uploads are counted when adding new uploads.

For byte level progress. Please implement the `TUSClientDelegate` protocol and set it as a the `delegate` property of `TUSClient`.

## Upload id's

By starting an upload you will receive an id. These id's are also passed to you via if you implement the `TUSClientDelegate`.
You can use these id's to identify which files are finished or failed. You can also delete these files on failure if you want. You can also use these id's to retry a failed upload.

Note that `TUSClient` will automatically retry an upload a few times, but will eventually give up, after which it will report an error. At a later moment you can call the `retry` method and try again.

*Note that calling `retry` before an upload is finished, will cause undefined behavior.*

## Starting a new session 

An upload can fail at any time. Even when an app is in the background.

Therefore, after starting a new app session, we recommend you inspect any failed uploads that may have occurred and act accordingly.
For instance, you can decide to do something with the failed uploads such as retrying them, deleting them, or reporting to the user.


```swift
For instance, here is how you can initialize the client and check its failed uploads. Note that we first fetch the id's, after which retry the uploads.
  
tusClient = TUSClient(config: TUSConfig(server: URL(string: "https://tusd.tusdemo.net/files")!), sessionIdentifier: "TUS DEMO", storageDirectory: URL(string: "/TUS")!)
tusClient.delegate = self
tusClient.start()
        
do {
  // When starting, you can retrieve the locally stored uploads that are marked as failure, and handle those.
  // E.g. Maybe some uploads failed from a last session, or failed from a background upload.
  let ids = try tusClient.failedUploadIds()
  for id in ids {
    // You can either retry a failed upload...
    try tusClient.retry(id: id)
    // ...alternatively, you can delete them too
    // tusClient.removeCacheFor(id: id)
  }
} catch {
  // Could not fetch failed id's from disk
}

```

## Background uploading

Available from iOS13, you can schedule uploads to be performed in the background using the `scheduleBackgroundTasks()` method on `TUSClient`. 

Scheduled tasks are handled by iOS. Which means that each device will decide when it's best to upload in the background. Such as when it has a wifi connection and late at night.

As an example from the `SceneDelegate` found in the example app, you can schedule them accordingly:

```swift
class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {

    // ... snip
    
    func sceneDidEnterBackground(_ scene: UIScene) {
        // Called as the scene transitions from the foreground to the background.
        tusClient.scheduleBackgroundTasks()
    }
}
```

If you incorporate background-uploading, we strongly recommend you to inspect any failed uploads that may have occured in the background. Please refer to [Starting a new Session](#Starting a new Session) for more information.

## Example app

Please refer to the [example app](/TUSKitExample) inside this project to see how to add photos from a PHPicker, using SwiftUI. You can also use the `PHPicker` mechanic for UIKit.

## Parallelism 

At the time of writing, this client does not support TUS' concatenation option. 
It does, however, automatically support parallel uploads in a single client. It does also support multiple clients.

## Underlying Mechanics

The `TUSClient` will retry a failed upload two times (three total attempts) before reporting it as an error.

The `TUSClient` will try to upload a file fully, and if it gets interrupted (e.g. broken connection or app is killed), it will continue where it left of.

The `TUSClient` stores files locally to upload them. It will use the `storageDirectory` path that is passed in the initializer. Or create a default directory inside the documentsdir at /TUS .

The `TUSClient` will automatically removed locally stored files once their upload is complete.

## Multiple instances

`TUSClient` supports multiple instances for simultaneous unrelated uploads.

Warning: Multiple clients should not share the same `storageDirectory`. Give each client their own directory to work from, or bugs may occur.

Please note that `TUSClient` since version 3.0.0 is *not* a singleton anymore. 

If you strongly feel you want a singleton, you can still make one using the static keyword.

```swift
final class MyClass {
  static let tusClient: TUSClient = ...
}
```

But we discourage you from doing so because it makes resetting between tests harder, and it becomes problematic in a multi-threaded environment.
