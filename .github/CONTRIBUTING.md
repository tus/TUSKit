# 🎉Contributing to TUSKit🎉
  So you want to contribute to TUSkit? Well that's great! We love the help, input and insight we get from the community to build the best and most reliable iOS SDK for the `tus.io` Protocol. 
  However to keep things clean and neat we ask you follow these small guidelines to help ensure everything runs smoothly.

## Pull Requests
  Please direct all Pull Requests to the `development` branch of the repo, to ensure that master will always match with the CocoaPod.
  
  Also please
  
  * Make sure all code is clean and readable
  * Is this solves an issue, mark the issue number in the PR
  * If this is a new feature, why do you think it's good addtion?
    
  
  
## Issues
  When reporting an issue please gives us all the information you can. A few key notes to hit are.
  
  * Is this issue present on any other SDK for tus?
  * What version of the procotol are you using?
  * What version of TUSKit are you using?
  * What sever SDK are you using?
  * What iOS versions have you tried TUSKit on?
  * Explain the issue in as much detail as you can
  * Provide as much code as you can from your implementation  
  
Issues such as "TUSKit not working" will not get us very far... 

## That's All Folks!
  We might add some more guidelines as the project grows. Our main goal is to maintain a healthy and readable codebase we can all benefit from. 
  
  Love,
  TUSKit
