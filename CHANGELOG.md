func uploadFailed(id: UUID, error: Error, context: [String : String]?, client: TUSClient) {
    Task { @MainActor in
        uploads[id] = .failed(error: error)
        
        if case TUSClientError.couldNotUploadFile(underlyingError: let underlyingError) = error,
           case TUSAPIError.failedRequest(let response) = underlyingError {
            print("upload failed with response \(response)")
        }
    }
}
```
